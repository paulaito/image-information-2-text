At the top, there's a question posed as if it were an instruction or a prompt for the next step in the game: ""Got the first dose?"" This suggests that the flowchart starts from this point, indicating that the viewer has already received their first dose in the game.

The middle box is a more straightforward instruction, stating ""No. Don't know"". This could be interpreted as an admission of uncertainty or confusion regarding the second dose strategy.

The bottom box provides two possible outcomes based on the player's response to the question. If the player chooses to ""Got second dose?"", it leads to another set of instructions for the next step in the game. However, if the player responds with ""Yes 1 dose"", it indicates that they have received only one dose and are now at the end of this part of the flowchart.

The two additional text boxes contain a question and an instruction for the player's response to the ""No."" outcome. These further guide the player on how to proceed after admitting uncertainty or confusion about their strategy.
