data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text0.png,"To break down the diagram and explain its components and interrelations, we analyze the **flow of a systematic review or meta-analysis process**. The diagram illustrates a sequential workflow for identifying, screening, and analyzing research records. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of each component and how they interact.

---

### **Key Components and Their Roles**

#### **1. Initial Sources (Input)**
- **Database searches (n = 408)**  
  - *Description:* Searches conducted in academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Web of Science).  
  - *Role:* Provides the first batch of records (408 records).  

- **Conference abstracts (n = 16)**  
  - *Description:* Records from scientific conferences.  
  - *Role:* Adds a smaller but valuable dataset (16 records).  

- **clinicaltrials.gov (n = 68)**  
  - *Description:* A registry of clinical trials.  
  - *Role:* Adds more records related to clinical research (68 records).  

**Interrelation:**  
These three sources collectively generate the total number of records:  
$$ 408 \, (\text{database}) + 16 \, (\text{conference}) + 68 \, (\text{clinical trials}) = 492 \, (\text{records identified}) $$  
This “Records identified” step aggregates all records from the three sources.  

---

#### **2. Identifying Records**
- **Records identified (n = 492)**  
  - *Description:* The combined list of records from the three sources.  
  - *Role:* Represents the total number of records that have been identified but not yet screened.  

**Interrelation:**  
This is the **starting point** for the next steps. It serves as the input to “Records screened.”

---

#### **3. Screening Process**
- **Records screened (n = 492)**  
  - *Description:* The step where identified records are evaluated for relevance.  
  - *Role:* Filters out irrelevant records, duplicates, and clearly irrelevant ones.  

**Interrelation:**  
This is where the **first screening actions** occur:  
- **Duplicates removed:** Ensures only unique records remain (reduces redundancy).  
- **Clearly irrelevant records removed:** Removes records not relevant to the research question (e.g., non-clinical studies).  

After this step, the process moves to **independent screening**.  

---

#### **4. Independent Screening**
- **Records independently screened by two reviewers (n = 492)**  
  - *Description:* Two reviewers independently evaluate each record to ensure consistency and quality.  
  - *Role:* Ensures unbiased and thorough screening.  

**Interrelation:**  
This step is critical for validation. After “Records screened,” the process transitions to **Full-text articles retrieved.**

---

#### **5. Retrieval of Full Text**
- **Full-text articles retrieved (n = 492)**  
  - *Description:* The process of obtaining full-text versions of the selected records.  
  - *Role:* Provides access to the content of the articles for analysis.  

**Interrelation:**  
This step takes the “Records independently screened” data (n = 492) and applies the full-text access to the selected records.  

---

#### **6. Update**
- **Update**  
  - *Description:* A step where the process may be updated (e.g., based on new findings or to correct errors).  
  - *Role:* Ensures the process remains current or adjusts for any issues.  

**Interrelation:**  
The process is advanced from “Full-text articles retrieved” to **Update**.  

---

#### **7. Termination**
- **Stop the process**  
  - *Description:* The final step of halting the systematic review process.  
  - *Role:* Signals the completion of the workflow.  

**Interrelation:**  
This step is reached only after **Update**.

---

### **Summary of Interrelations**
- **Data Flow:** The diagram shows a clear progression from initial sources to final termination.  
  - *Database searches → Records identified (408 + 16 + 68 = 492)*  
  - *Records identified → Records screened (492)*  
  - *Records screened → Duplicates removed, Clearly irrelevant records removed → Records independently screened by two reviewers (492)*  
  - *Records independently screened by two reviewers → Full-text articles retrieved (492)*  
  - *Full-text articles retrieved → Update → Stop the process*  

- **Purpose of Each Step:**  
  - The initial sources generate a pool of records.  
  - Screening eliminates duplicates and irrelevant records.  
  - Independent review ensures quality and reduces bias.  
  - Full-text retrieval enables analysis.  
  - The process is continuously updated to refine results.  

This workflow reflects a **systematic, rigorous approach** to identifying and analyzing research evidence, ensuring reliability and completeness.

---

### **Final Notes**
- **Total Records:** The total number of records is preserved at each step (n = 492), as no records are added or removed during the process (except in the *Update* step).  
- **Quality Control:** The inclusion of “Duplicates removed” and “Clearly irrelevant records removed” ensures the dataset remains focused and efficient.  
- **Independence:** The “Records independently screened by two reviewers” step promotes unbiased evaluation.  

This process is fundamental to evidence-based practice in fields like medicine, public health, and social sciences.","{'duration': 32.04533267021179, 'cpu_used': 0.0, 'mem_used': 323584}","Database searches n=408, Conference abstracts n=16, and clinicaltrials.gov n=68 are connected with Records identified n=492 which is then connected with both Records screened and Duplicates removed. Records screened is then connected with both Records independently screened by two reviewers and Clearly irrelevant records removed. Then, Records independently screened by two reviewers is connected with Full-text articles retrieved and Irrelevant records removed. Full-text articles retrieved is then connected with both Stop the process and Update.",Break down the diagram into its components and explain their interrelations.
data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text1.png,"To detail the hierarchical structure of the components in the provided flowchart diagram, we analyze the **decision points** and **branch paths** in a structured manner. Here is the breakdown of the hierarchy:

---

### **1. Root Node: ""Got the first dose?""**  
- This is the **topmost decision point** and serves as the **starting point** for the flow.  
- **Children of this node**:  
  - **""Yes"" branch**: Leads to the terminal node **""1 dose""**.  
  - **""No/Don't know"" branch**: Leads to the next decision node **""Got second dose?""**.  

---

### **2. Intermediate Node: ""Got second dose?""**  
- This node is a **child of the first decision node (""Got the first dose?"")**.  
- **Children of this node**:  
  - **""Yes"" branch**: Leads to the terminal node **""1 dose""**.  
  - **""No/Don't know"" branch**: Leads to the terminal node **""2 doses""**.  

---

### **3. Terminal Nodes**  
- **""1 dose""**: A terminal node reached when *either* ""Yes"" to the first question *or* ""Yes"" to the second question.  
- **""2 doses""**: A terminal node reached when *No/Don't know* to the second question.  

---

### **Hierarchical Structure Summary**  
The diagram forms a **decision tree-like hierarchy** with the following layers:  
1. **Level 1 (Root)**: *Got the first dose?*  
   - **Branch 1 (Yes)**: → *1 dose* (Terminal)  
   - **Branch 2 (No/Don't know)**: → *Got second dose?* (Level 2)  

2. **Level 2**: *Got second dose?*  
   - **Branch 1 (Yes)**: → *1 dose* (Terminal)  
   - **Branch 2 (No/Don't know)**: → *2 doses* (Terminal)  

---

### **Key Observations**  
- The flow starts at the **root node** (*Got the first dose?*), which triggers a sequence of decisions.  
- The hierarchy is **non-linear** (as it includes conditional paths) but **structured** with nested decision points.  
- Each **decision node** has **two child branches** (either ""Yes"" or ""No/Don't know""), leading to terminal outcomes.

data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text11.png,"To analyze the dependency between the elements in the diagram, we examine the **flow of information/data** and the **relationships** between each component:  

### 1. **Element Identification and Roles**  
- **Sensor**: Initiates the process by sending data to the system (e.g., temperature, motion, or other physical inputs).  
- **Arduino**: Acts as the central processing unit that receives data from the Sensor and sends commands to the Home automation system.  
- **Home automation**: Executes actions (e.g., turning lights on/off, adjusting HVAC systems) based on commands from the Arduino.  

### 2. **Dependency Analysis**  
The diagram depicts a **sequential data flow** (Sensor → Arduino → Home automation), meaning each element relies on the next in the chain for functionality:  

| Element        | Dependency on Other Elements                     | Explanation                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensor**     | Arduino                                              | The Sensor sends data *to* the Arduino. Without the Arduino, the Sensor’s data cannot be processed or acted upon. |
| **Arduino**    | Sensor, Home automation                            | The Arduino *receives* data from the Sensor and *sends commands* to Home automation. It depends on both the Sensor (for input) and Home automation (for output). |
| **Home automation** | Arduino                                              | The Home automation *receives* commands *from* the Arduino. Without the Arduino, the Home automation cannot execute tasks. |

### 3. **Key Dependencies**  
- **Sensor → Arduino**: The Sensor must send data to the Arduino to be processed. (The Sensor’s output is dependent on the Arduino’s processing.)  
- **Arduino → Home automation**: The Arduino must send commands to the Home automation to trigger actions. (The Home automation’s execution is dependent on the Arduino’s commands.)  
- **Arduino’s role as intermediary**: The Arduino acts as the **bridge** between the Sensor and Home automation. Without it, the data from the Sensor cannot reach the Home automation, and vice versa.  

### 4. **Relationship Summary**  
- **Bidirectional dependency**: The Sensor depends on the Arduino for data processing, and the Arduino depends on the Sensor for data input.  
- **Unidirectional dependency**: The Home automation depends on the Arduino for command execution, and the Arduino depends on the Home automation for receiving commands (though the diagram shows a single arrow for the output of the Arduino to Home automation).  

In short, the **dependencies** are structured as a **chain**:  
1. *Sensor* **depends on** *Arduino* to process its data.  
2. *Arduino* **depends on** *Sensor* to receive data.  
3. *Arduino* **depends on** *Home automation* to send commands.  
4. *Home automation* **depends on** *Arduino* to execute actions.  

This chain ensures that the system operates as a cohesive unit: the Sensor provides input, the Arduino processes it, and the Home automation acts on the result.","{'duration': 16.467171669006348, 'cpu_used': 0.0, 'mem_used': 0}",Sensor is connected with Arduino which is then connected with Home automation.,Analyze the diagram and describe the dependency between its elements.
data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text12.png,"To detail the cause-and-effect relationships within the provided flowchart, we analyze each step's dependencies and logical progression. The diagram describes a process for determining the arrival time of a trip based on inferred routing data. Below is a clear breakdown of the causal relationships:

---

### **1. Initial Trigger**  
- **Inferred OD** (blue hexagon) is the **starting point**.

  - **Effect**: *Get array of paths from O to D* (white rectangle) is performed.  
  - **Relationship**: *Inferred OD → Get array of paths from O to D*  

---

### **2. Path Processing**

  - **Effect**: *Find the best route* (white rectangle) is performed.  
  - **Relationship**: *Get array of paths from O to D → Find the best route*  

---

### **3. Trip Existence Check**

  - **Effect**: *Trip exists?* evaluates whether a valid trip is present.  
  - **Relationship**: *Find the best route → Trip exists?*  

---

### **4. Trip Validation**  
- **Trip exists?** (diamond) has two branches:  
  - **Yes** → *Find arrival time at segment aligning location* (white rectangle).  
    - **Cause**: *Trip exists? (yes)* confirms the trip is valid.  
    - **Effect**: *Find arrival time at segment aligning location* is executed.  
    - **Relationship**: *Trip exists? (yes) → Find arrival time at segment aligning location*  
  - **No** → *Arrival Time Inference Fails* (red oval).

    - **Effect**: *Arrival Time Inference Fails* (terminal state).  
    - **Relationship**: *Trip exists? (no) → Arrival Time Inference Fails*  

---

### **5. Arrival Time Calculation**  
- **Find arrival time at segment aligning location** (white rectangle) is the **next step** after determining if a trip exists.  
  - **Cause**: *Find arrival time at segment aligning location* calculates the arrival time at a specified segment.  
  - **Effect**: *Arrival time?* (diamond) is evaluated to determine if the arrival time is valid.  
  - **Relationship**: *Find arrival time at segment aligning location → Arrival time?*  

---

### **6. Final Segment Validation**  
- **Arrival time?** (diamond) has two branches:  
  - **Yes** → *Final segment* (diamond).  
    - **Cause**: *Arrival time? (yes)* confirms the arrival time is valid.  
    - **Effect**: *Final segment* is identified.  
    - **Relationship**: *Arrival time? (yes) → Final segment*  
  - **No** → *Next trip* (white rectangle).  
    - **Cause**: *Arrival time? (no)* confirms the arrival time is invalid.  
    - **Effect**: *Next trip* is initiated.  
    - **Relationship**: *Arrival time? (no) → Next trip*  

---

### **7. Final Calculation**  
- **Final segment** (diamond) determines if the journey is complete.  
  - **Cause**: *Final segment* confirms the journey is final.  
  - **Effect**: *alighting time + egress time = arrival time* (green oval).  
  - **Relationship**: *Final segment (yes) → alighting time + egress time = arrival time*  

---

### **8. Loop for Additional Trips**  
- **Next trip** (white rectangle) is the **next step** after determining the arrival time is invalid.  
  - **Cause**: *Next trip* initiates a new trip.  
  - **Effect**: *Check another one* (white rectangle) is executed.  
  - **Relationship**: *Next trip → Check another one*  

- **Check another one** (white rectangle) loops back to *Find arrival time at segment aligning location*.  
  - **Cause**: *Check another one* identifies a new segment for the process.  
  - **Effect**: *Find arrival time at segment aligning location* is repeated.  
  - **Relationship**: *Check another one → Find arrival time at segment aligning location*  

---

### **9. Terminal State**  
- **Arrival Time Inference Fails** (red oval) is the **only terminal state**.  
  - **Cause**: *Trip exists? (no)*.  
  - **Effect**: Process ends with a failure.

data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text13.png,"To detail the hierarchical structure of the components in the provided flowchart, we analyze the **parent-child relationships** between each node, focusing on how components are organized hierarchically (from top-level to subordinate nodes). Here’s a breakdown of the structure:

---

### **1. Root Node**
- **Start (red oval)**:  
  - **Role**: The initiating point of the process.  
  - **Hierarchy**: Root (no parent).  
  - **Connections**: Directly leads to *Step 1*.

---

### **2. Level 1: Initial Process Steps**
- **Step 1 (green rectangle)**:  
  - **Role**: The first processing step in the sequence.  
  - **Hierarchy**: Child of *Start*.  
  - **Connections**: Directly leads to *Decision* (via a downward arrow).

---

### **3. Level 2: Decision Node**
- **Decision (yellow diamond)**:  
  - **Role**: A decision point that splits the process into two paths based on the outcome.  
  - **Hierarchy**: Child of *Step 1*.  
  - **Connections**:  
    - **Yes branch**: Leads to *End* (red oval).  
    - **No branch**: Leads to *Update* (green rectangle).

---

### **4. Level 3: Subsequent Nodes**
- **End (red oval)**:  
  - **Role**: The termination point of the process.  
  - **Hierarchy**: Child of *Decision*.  
  - **Connections**: No further connections (final node).

- **Update (green rectangle)**:  
  - **Role**: A processing step triggered when the decision outcome is *No*.  
  - **Hierarchy**: Child of *Decision*.  
  - **Connections**: Leads back to *Step 1* (creating a loop).

---

### **5. Level 4: Looping Component**
- **Step 1 (green rectangle)**:  
  - **Role**: A core processing step that is part of a loop.  
  - **Hierarchy**: Child of *Update*.  
  - **Connections**: Leads back to *Decision* (via a downward arrow).  
  - **Note**: *Step 1* is also a child of *Update*, reinforcing the loop.

---

### **Summary of Hierarchical Structure**
The hierarchical relationships can be represented as a **tree-like structure** with parent-child relationships:

```
Start (Root)  
├─ Step 1 (Child of Start)  
│  └─ Decision (Child of Step 1)  
│     ├─ End (Child of Decision)  
│     └─ Update (Child of Decision)  
│      └─ Step 1 (Child of Update)  
└─ End (Child of Decision)  
```

---

### **Key Observations**
- **Loop Formation**: The *Update* node leads back to *Step 1*, creating a feedback loop where the process continues to *Step 1* (and thus *Decision*) after *Update*.
- **Non-Linear Flow**: While the structure is hierarchical, the process is non-linear due to the decision point and loop. This is typical in flowcharts for processes with conditional branches and iterative steps.
- **Hierarchical Depth**:  
  - *Start* is at the root.  
  - *Step 1* is a direct child of *Start*.  
  - *Decision* is a direct child of *Step 1*.  
  - *Update* and *Step 1* form a recursive loop.

---

### **Final Hierarchical Breakdown**
- **Start** → **Step 1** → **Decision** → *End* (Yes)  
- **Start** → **Step 1** → **Decision** → *Update* (No) → **Step 1** (via loop)

data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text14.png,"### **Process Flow Summary**

The diagram illustrates a workflow that begins with **Memory** and progresses through a series of steps. Here's a clear breakdown of the interactions between components:

---

#### **Step-by-Step Interactions:**

1. **Start at Memory**  
   - The process initiates with **Memory**, which is the starting point of the workflow.

2. **Execute Tx: Epely Maneuver**  
   - The first action taken is **Tx: Epely Maneuver**, which triggers the next step.

3. **Perform Positional Test**  
   - After the **Tx: Epely Maneuver**, a **Positional Test** is conducted. This step evaluates the system's response to the previous action.

4. **Random Allocation Decision**  
   - Following the **Positional Test**, a **Random Allocation** step occurs. This is a decision point where two branches are presented:
     - **Malware Test**
     - **Tx: Semont Maneuver**

5. **Branching Paths**  
   - From **Random Allocation**, the process splits into two options:
     - **Malware Test** → Leads back to **Positional Test**
     - **Tx: Semont Maneuver** → Leads back to **Positional Test**

6. **Loop Back to Positional Test**  
   - Both branches **lead back to the Positional Test**, indicating a feedback loop that continues the process.

7. **End the Process**

data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text4.png,"To elucidate the sequence of operations depicted in the flowchart, we analyze the steps and their logical order:  

1. **Start**: The process begins.  
2. **Add**: An addition operation is performed (e.g., adding a value to a data structure or database).  
3. **Sub**: A subtraction operation is executed (e.g., subtracting a value from the current data structure or database).  
4. **Update**: The data structure is updated based on the results of the addition and subtraction operations.  
5. **Print**: The updated data is printed (e.g., displaying the final result of the operations).  
6. **Stop**: The process terminates.  

### Explanation of the Sequence:
- The flowchart follows a **strict sequential order** without branching (only one arrow from the ""Sub"" step to the ""Update"" step).  
- Each step is a distinct operation that must be completed before moving to the next step.  
- The ""Sub"" step is a process where subtraction is performed (potentially as part of a conditional logic check, but in this diagram, it is treated as a single operation leading directly to the ""Update"" step).

data/diagram_image_to_text/diagram_image_to_text6.png,"To analyze the flowchart and comment on the **linkage and flow** among entities, we examine the sequence, dependencies, and logical relationships between each step. Below is a structured breakdown:

---

### **1. Overall Flow and Sequence**
The diagram depicts a **sequential, linear workflow** where each step logically follows the previous one. The order is:
- **Bootstrap** → **Installation** → **Copy** → **Unpack** → **Register** → **Config** → **Zip / Image / ISO**

This sequence implies a step-by-step process for an installation and configuration task, with each phase serving as a prerequisite for the next.

---

### **2. Key Dependencies and Logical Linkage**
Each step is explicitly dependent on the prior step, forming a clear **causal relationship**:
- **Bootstrap** initiates the process (e.g., booting the system).  
- **Installation** requires Bootstrap to proceed (e.g., initiating the installation of components).  
- **Copy** depends on Installation (e.g., transferring files to the target system).  
- **Unpack** follows Copy (e.g., extracting files to their intended locations).  
- **Register** requires Unpack (e.g., registering software or configurations after files are unpacked).  
- **Config** depends on Register (e.g., finalizing the system setup with registered components).  

This creates a **chain of dependencies** where each step is a prerequisite for the next. For example:
- *Installation* must occur before *Copy*.
- *Unpack* must occur before *Register*.
- *Register* must occur before *Config*.

---

### **3. Final Output and Context**
After **Config**, the process leads to **three distinct output formats**:  
- **Zip**: A compressed file (likely for distribution or storage).  
- **Image**: A bootable image (e.g., for virtual environments or hardware).  
- **ISO**: A standard installation media (e.g., used for deploying software).  

This suggests that **Config** is the final step before delivering the installation. The three outputs reflect different ways to package the installation for use.

---

### **4. Observations on Workflow Clarity**
- The flow is **logical and intuitive**, with each step clearly defined and ordered.  
- Critical steps like **Register** and **Config** are emphasized as prerequisites for the final deliverables.  
- The diagram highlights the importance of **registration** (a step before configuration), which is a key step in many installation workflows.  

---

### **5. Summary of Linkage and Flow**
The diagram represents a **well-defined, sequential workflow** for an installation and configuration process. Each step is a **prerequisite** for the next, ensuring a logical progression from booting the system through installation, unpacking, registration, and configuration. The final output formats (Zip, Image, ISO) are a result of the **Config** step, emphasizing that the installation is complete only after configuration.

---

### **Conclusion**
The linkage between entities is **strictly sequential and dependent**, with each step logically following the previous one. The flow is clear, with a focus on the foundational steps (Bootstrap, Installation, Copy, Unpack, Register) leading to the final configuration. The output formats (Zip, Image, ISO) emerge as a natural consequence of the **Config** step, making the entire process a coherent and structured workflow.","{'duration': 24.21599841117859, 'cpu_used': 0.0, 'mem_used': 0}","bootstrap is connected with Installation which is then connected with Copy which is further connected with Unpack.

data/chart2text/chart2text7.png,"This is a **horizontal bar chart** showing the **share of respondents** (as a percentage) who reported each concern related to the aftermath of the pandemic. Here’s a breakdown of the data and its key message:  


### Step 1: Understand the Chart Structure  
- **Y-axis**: Lists the specific concerns (e.g., “Fear of the return of the epidemic/disease,” “Lack of funding,” etc.).  
- **X-axis**: Represents the *percentage of respondents* (ranging from 0% to 40%).  
- **Bars**: Each bar’s length corresponds to the percentage of respondents who reported that concern.    


### Step 2: Analyze the Data (Ordered by Percentage)  
The highest percentages (largest bars) are:  
1. **Fear of the return of the epidemic/disease** (33.2%) → *This is the most common concern.*  
2. **Lack of funding** (21.4%) → *Second most common concern.*  
3. **Current “no” for planning trips** (11.5%) → *Third most common concern.*  
4. **Aversion to traveling at all** (9.6%) → *Fourth most common concern.*  
5. **Uncertainty related to job and income maintenance** (7.7%) → *Fifth most common concern.*  
6. **I have to sort out other things after the pandemic ends** (4.8%) → *Sixth most common concern.*  
7. **Desire to save money** (4.5%) → *Seventh most common concern.*  
8. **Hard to say** (3.8%) → *Eighth most common concern.*  
9. **No vacation time to be taken** (2.6%) → *Lowest concern.*    


### Step 3: Extract the Core Message  
The chart reveals that **respondents are heavily concerned with pandemic-related issues**, with three key categories dominating:  
- **Health/Well-being**: Fear of the return of the epidemic/disease (33.2%), which suggests widespread anxiety about re-infection or health risks.  
- **Financial Stability**: Lack of funding (21.4%) and uncertainty around job income (7.7%), which indicates financial stressors post-pandemic.  
- **Travel/Planning**: “No planning trips” (11.5%) and aversion to traveling at all (9.6%), showing disruptions to travel and social activities.  

The *lowest concerns* (2.6%) involve “no vacation time to be taken” and “hard to say,” but these are still relatively significant compared to other issues.  

### Key Takeaway  
The data illustrates that **the pandemic has created widespread stress and anxiety** across multiple domains—health, finance, and travel. While health concerns (fear of epidemics) are the most prominent, financial and travel-related issues are also deeply troubling for many. This underscores the profound impact of the pandemic on people’s daily lives and long-term planning.","{'duration': 15.106186151504517, 'cpu_used': 0.0, 'mem_used': 0}","One-fifth of the respondents in Poland are in a poor financial situation.
